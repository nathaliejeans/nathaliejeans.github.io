            <h1><i>Hi, I'm Nathalie!</i></h1>
            <p>
                <br>I want to build ethical, fair, and people-first technology by 
                transforming something traditionally 
                robotic into something emotionally meaningful. When creating, I value whether a product fulfills its
                purpose in the larger system, and believe that user experience is
                key to forming those human-based connections.
                </br>

                <br>I'm currently a freshman studying Electrical and Computer 
                Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I've interned 
                as a Machine Learning Scientist at integrate.ai, where I worked on 
                creating a metric to quantify the customer centricity of clients' 
                business decisions. I also co-led the first cohort of high school
                girls participating in SheEO's funding cycle, voting on
                women-led startups to receive grants. Before that, I was a software
                developer and UX/UI designer for an app that automated the transactions
                of used uniform sales.
                </br>

                <br>Various articles of mine have been in Medium's <i>Towards
                Data Science</i> and <i>Data Driven Investor</i> publications. <i>The 
                Backpropagation Algorithm Demystified</i> was featured on the
                Practical AI Podcast and in KDnuggets. I spoke about
                generating music with AI at the <i>Venturing into Tech</i> conference at the
                University of Toronto, St. George.
